        Hi there! I am Fran. This is a webapp made after sometime without programming
        to refresh, update and get better coding, JS and Angular skills.
        Here I will try to detail the things I practiced and/or learned.

    </p>

    <p>
        Please understand that, as it is a practice project, code is maybe "overcommented", but I found it necessary.
    </p>

    <p>You can see the code on //TODO mete el link a github aqui GitHub, also don´t forget to follow me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-javier-prieto-gut/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/home?lang=es" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

    

    <ul id="readMeListId">
        <li>
            I used <b>reactive forms</b> -until now, I was more used to template driven ones-, with built-in and <b>custom validators</b>. For example, custom validator is created to ensure, if user inputs same exact date, form will be invalid.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can enter the dates in the order you want. No choronological order required. 
            For example you can set 24/06/2021 on the first box and 06/07/2009 on the second. 
            It was kind of logic challenge to control it and make usability a little better
            than forcing the user to set ordered dates or showing negative results, like I have seen on similar websites.    
        </li>
        <li>
            I used <a href="https://byabbe.se/on-this-day/" target="_blank">an external API</a> to get the events occurred on each date. 
            I managed to get 5 random results from the api for each date, 
            also ensuring they can´t be repeated.
        </li>
        <li>
            To get the results of those API, it was made with Angular´s httpClient.get() method.
            It returns an Observable so I had to apply some Reactive Programming skills.
            As it also involves async requests, I used promises to manage results (Also checked with async/await), 
            to ensure I obtain and control data flow the way I need.
            To obtain the random 5 results mentioned above I used vanilla JS methods like Math.random(),
            because RXJS operators like <i>take</i> don´t work here. Reason is, the events
            are emitted by the API all of them together, to be able to use the take() operator they should be emitted by the Observable one by one.

        </li>
        <li>
            Used interfaces to create custom data types to be manage the results shown to the user, 
            it makes data retrieved by the API easier to manipulate and ensures integrity and maintenance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Used basic angular animations to flip the box with the results and the button to show events ocurred on each date.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Basic testing with karma and jasmine, maybe learn Protactor in the future if I find easier and faster to automate.
        </li>
