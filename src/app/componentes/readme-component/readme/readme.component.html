        Hi there! I am Fran. This is a webapp made after sometime without programming
        to refresh, update and get better coding, JS and Angular skills.
        Here I will try to detail <span id="learned">the things I practiced and/or learned.</span>

    </p>

    <p>
        Please understand that, as it is a practice project, code is maybe "overcommented", but I found it necessary.
    </p>

    <p>You can see the code on <a href="https://github.com/Franweb79/Datepedia" target="_blank">Github</a> GitHub, also don´t forget to follow me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-javier-prieto-gut/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/home?lang=es" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

    

    <ul id="readMeListId">
        <li>
            I used <span id="learned">reactive forms</span> -until now, I was more used to template driven ones-, with built-in and <span id="learned">custom validators</span>. For example, custom validator is created to ensure, if user inputs same exact date, form will be invalid.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can enter the dates in the order you want. No choronological order required. 
            For example you can set 24/06/2021 on the first box and 06/07/2009 on the second. 
            It was kind of logic challenge to control it and make usability a little better
            than forcing the user to set ordered dates or showing negative results, like I have seen on similar websites.    
        </li>
        <li>
            I  <span id="learned">used an external API</span><a href="https://byabbe.se/on-this-day/" target="_blank"> (visit here)</a> to get the events occurred on each date. 
            I managed to get 5 random results from the api for each date, 
            also ensuring they can´t be repeated.
        </li>
        <li>
            To get the results of those API, the <span id="learned"> async HTTP requests</span> were made with <span id="learned">Angular´s httpClient</span> get() method.
            It returns an <span id="learned">Observable</span> so I had to apply some <span id="learned">Reactive Programming skills</span>.
            As it also involves async requests, I used <span id="learned">promises</span> to manage results (Also checked with <span id="learned">async/await</span>), 
            to ensure I obtain and control data flow the way I need.
            To obtain the random 5 results mentioned above I used <span id="learned">vanilla JS</span> methods like Math.random(),
            because <span id="learned">RXJS operators</span> like <i>take</i> don´t work here. Reason is, the events
            are emitted by the API all of them together, to be able to use the take() operator they should be emitted by the Observable one by one.

        </li>
        <li>
            Used <span id="learned">interfaces</span> to create <span id="learned">custom data types</span> to be manage the results shown to the user, 
            it makes data retrieved by the API easier to manipulate and ensures integrity and maintenance. Also used an interface to create a custom error object type, and to manage error messages,
            if something if wrong with the API for example.
        </li>
        <li>
            Used basic <span id="learned">angular animations</span> to flip the box with the results and the button to show events ocurred on each date.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Basic <span id="learned">testing with karma and jasmine</span>, maybe learn Protactor in the future if I find easier and faster to automate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Form styles found <a href="https://codepen.io/prathkum/pen/OJRvVzY" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Customized <a [routerLink]="['/thisiserrorpage']" >404 error page</a>. Used code available <a href="https://codepen.io/Navedkhan012/pen/vrWQMY" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </li> 
        <li>
            Other libraries used are <span id="learned">Bootstrap</span> and Font Awesome.
        </li>
