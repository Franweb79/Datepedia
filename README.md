# what does this program?

- Used promises to get used to async programming. As Angular´s httpClient get() method provides async request, I had to use Promises (also checked with async/await) , to ensure I obtain and control data flow the way I need
- Date inputs are ordered. 
- Random results from the api for each date, ensuring can´t be repeated.Promesas, cambio d efecha ordenada, resultados aleatorios
- Used interfaces to create custom data type to be shown to the user, it makes data retrieved by the API easier to manipulate and ensure integrity and maintenance
- Used angular animations
- Reactive forms with built-in and custom validators. For example, custom validator is created to ensure, if user inputs same exact date, form will be invalid.
- Basic testing with karma and jasmine, maybe learn Protactor in the future if I find easier and faster to automate.
- Form styles found here https://codepen.io/prathkum/pen/OJRvVzY
- You can enter the dates in the order you want. It was kind of logic challenge
- Customized 404 error page. Code snippet used available here https://codepen.io/Navedkhan012/pen/vrWQMY


//TODO ordena esto bien. ACUANDO HAGAMOS LO DE QUE SI LA FECHA ES LA MISMA EN EL MODAL SOLO SALGA UNA VEZ, PONERLO
