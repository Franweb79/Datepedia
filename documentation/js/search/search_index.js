If you see a comment on the code indicating\n        \"check README Notes for developers 18\", then you can check that section, and on number 18\n        you will find useful information about logic I used. However, nex time I will try to focus more on the \"why\" than on \"how\" or \"what\"\n    \n    \n    This is a little list of things I implemented or done on this project\n\n    \n        \n            I used reactive forms -until now, I was more used to template driven ones-, with built-in and custom validators.

No choronological order required. \n            For example you can set 24/06/2021 on the first box and 06/07/2009 on the second. \n            It was kind of logic challenge to control it and make usability a little better\n            than forcing the user to set ordered dates or showing negative results, like I have seen on similar websites.    \n        \n        \n            I  used an external API (visit here) to get the events occurred on each date. \n            I managed to get 5 random results from the api for each date, \n            also ensuring they can´t be repeated.\n        \n        \n            To get the results of those API, the  async HTTP requests were made with Angular´s httpClient get() method.\n            It returns an Observable so I had to apply some Reactive Programming skills.\n            As it also involves async requests, I used promises to manage results, \n            to ensure I obtain and control data flow the way I need.\n            To obtain the random 5 results mentioned above I used vanilla JS methods like Math.random(),\n            because RXJS operators like take don´t work here. Reason is, the events\n            are emitted by the API all of them together, to be able to use the take() operator they should be emitted by the Observable one by one.\n\n        \n        I also provide a branch on GitHub with the same code below, \n            but using async/await to see the differences. \n            Async await provides a cleaner code since the behavior\n            is more similar to what we see on synchronous code\n        \n            Used interfaces to create custom data types to be manage the results shown to the user, \n            it makes data retrieved by the API easier to manipulate and ensures integrity and maintenance. Also used an interface to create a custom error object type, and to manage error messages,\n            if something if wrong with the API for example.\n        \n        \n            Used basic angular animations to flip the box with the results and the button to show events ocurred on each date.\n        \n        \n        \n            Basic testing with karma and jasmine, maybe learn Protactor in the future if I find easier and faster to automate.\n        \n        \n            Form styles found here.\n        \n        \n            Customized 404 error page.

Used basic angular animations to flip the box with the results and the button to show events ocurred on each date.                                    Basic testing with karma and jasmine, maybe learn Protactor in the future if I find easier and faster to automate.                            Form styles found here.                            Customized 404 error page. Used code available here.                             Other libraries used are Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

As Angular´s httpClient get() method provides async request, I used Promises to ensure I obtain and control data flow the way I need.\nI also provide a branch with the same code below, but using async/await to see the differences. Async await provides a cleaner code since the behavior is more similar to what we see on synchronous code\nDate inputs are ordered. \nRandom results from the api for each date, ensuring can´t be repeated.Promesas, cambio d efecha ordenada, resultados aleatorios\nUsed interfaces to create custom data type to be shown to the user, it makes data retrieved by the API easier to manipulate and ensure integrity and maintenance\nUsed angular animations\nReactive forms with built-in and custom validators. For example, custom validator is created to ensure, if user inputs same exact date, form will be invalid.\nBasic testing with karma and jasmine, maybe learn Protactor in the future if I find easier and faster to automate.\nForm styles found here https://codepen.io/prathkum/pen/OJRvVzY\nYou can enter the dates in the order you want. It was kind of logic challenge\nCustomized 404 error page. Code snippet used available here https://codepen.io/Navedkhan012/pen/vrWQMY\nIf requested date has same day and month but different year (e.g: \"2021-04-06\" and \"2022-04-06\"), modal header will properly show date one time instead of two. Has no sense to show \"Some events happened on November 03 and November 03\"\nFor the same reason and in the same case from above, we control the async requests to the API to ensure we make only a request instead of two. We don´t need to request and show two times for a date with same day and month. With one object with events is enough.\n\nNOTES FOR DEVELOPERS\n1 -  \nwith Viewchild, we bind two properties on the child component\n\n firstDateToShowWhenFlipped\n\n lastDateToShowWhenFlipped\n\nThis are changed on each onSubmit() method like specified below\n\n this.showDays.firstDateToShowWhenFlipped=this._dates.convertArrayOfNumbersIntoString(firstOrderedDate);\n\n this.showDays.lastDateToShowWhenFlipped=this._dates.convertArrayOfNumbersIntoString(lastOrderedDate);\n\nThese way we ensure they will be properly changed and shown with correct values each time they are changed.\n\nOther way of sending data to child components is like we did on the HTML template this way, with valuetotalDays and isDivFlipped, which are properties on the child component which receive data from totalDays and isFlipped, which are properties on this current component.\n\n    \n\n\nIn both ways, the child component properties must be using the @Input() decorator to \"listen\".2 - \narrayOfEventsToShow is used here on modal component HTML template\nto show the events on a certain date.\n\nI have declared it as 'any' because in order to use it on the template\nis easier to access properties. With a more strict type was giving problems.\n//TODO look for a better solution\n\nIt receives its value from parent component show-days-component,\nthrough a property of parent component called arrayOfObjectsWithEvents\n\nBoth are binded on show-days-component HTML template\nand also value is assigned inside that component´s .ts code\non the _callApi service´s getEventsPromise() method3 - \n firstDateToShowWhenFlipped\n\nand\n\n lastDateToShowWhenFlipped\n\nThese 2 string properties will be used to show dates when this component is flipped.\n\nfor example: \"total days between 2021-06-01 and 2021-07-02 are... \"\n\nAs the order to show dates can be different on this component than on modal,\nbecause year is not present, I also will declare 2 new properties:\n\n firstDateToShowOnModal\n\n lastDateToShowOnModal4 - \n firstDateToShowOnModal\n\nand \n\n lastDateToShowOnModal\n\nare used to pass its values to child component app-modal, then values can be shown on the modal.\n\nThese two properties receive their values from date1 and date2 properties from the _dates service.\n\nWe use them because service is private, so can´t use it on the template (outside the class), so we need properties with public visibility in order to be used on component´s HTML template.\n\nAs date and date 2 have a number[] type, we will convert them to string with a custom method created on the service5 - \n arrayNumberWithFirstDateToBeSentToApi\n\nand\n\n arrayNumberWithLastDateToBeSentToApi\n\nThis two properties will be sent to the API on the proper order.\n\nWe need them because the API requires them to be numbers, so we can´t simply send the same string properties we declared above, to send dates to modals.\n\nAlso array of numbers can't be directly piped on the template as we can do with strings, so for the moment I find easier to do this way: \n\n  -string properties with dates to be shown on modals, \n  -array of numbers with dates to be sent to API6 - \nMaybe this arrayOfObjectsWithEvents could have been declared as customEvent type, with our own interface we have created, but I need to use the push() method on it so I find it better to be declared as array of Objects for now.\n\nThe value from this property will be sent to app-modal child component, \nto the property called arrayOfEventsToShow7 - \nTo show dates on modal, we need a different logic than the one we use to order the complete dates.\n\nWhy? On modal we show no year. We will only show month and day, so a valid order for:\n\n  2021-06-04 (second date to be shown)\n\nand\n\n  2020-08-02 (first date to be shown)\n\nwould not be a valid order for\n\n  06-04 (first date to be shown)\n\nand\n\n  08-02 (second date to be shown)\n\nWe can see order is different because we don´t take the year into account and that changes everything.\n\nSo we can´t simply do\n\n  this.firstDateToShowOnModal = this._dates.convertArrayOfNumbersIntoString(date1);\n\n  this.lastDateToShowOnModal = this._dates.convertArrayOfNumbersIntoString(date2);\n\nAlso note that we can´t either show on modal the complete dates \nbecause we are not showing events from e.g. 2021-06-04, but events from what happened on any 06-04 from any year.\n\nWe must take month and day from each date and then order then \nhaving only those values of month and day in mind.8 -\nHere we also need to order dates, as on convertDatesToModal().\n\nBut here I decided to create two new local string variables to store the string dates to send dates to the API, despite using the same string class properties we created to send dates to modal.\n\nThese local variables are \n\n  stringWithFirstDateToBeSentToApi\n\nand \n\n  stringWithLastDateToBeSentToApi\n\nReason is, logic here is similar but different than on convertDatesToModal().\n\nHere we don't need to show them on a template, just be used to be converted to Date objects and then be ordered, like also did on convertDatesToModal().\n\nThe array numbers we get from the _dates service can`t be converted to the Date objects we need to order dates, but that can be done with string properties.\n\nBut using the same string properties we have to show dates on modal, could cause flow not working fine. So that is why I decided to create different local string properties.\n\nAs said, we need Date objects to order dates, but we also need dates as number type (dates come as an array of numbers from the service so that work is done) to be sent to the API because this API requires them to be number type.\n\nI am aware that the code used to order dates on this method and on convertDatesToModal() is almost the same, so it can be refactored, but for now I let this way.9 - \nwe use a promise to ensure we control the async request done by _http:get() method which is called inside _dates service.\n\nSo, once we have 1st result with events corresponding to the 1st date, and added them as first element of an array to store the events of the 2 dates,we make the 2nd request (if month or day are different,otherwise we need to show results only one time).\n\nWhy do we only 2 requests if month or day are different? \n\ne.g. if we have \"results for november 05\" ,it has no sense to show\n    -5 results for november 05 (first request)\n    -and another 5 results again for november 05 (another request, which will be done only if date or month are different)10 -\ngetEventsPromise() will be used on show-days-component.\n\nPARAMETERS:month and day of the date to search\n\nWe need it to make a promise -or with async/await, check branch async-await-, to be sure we have the data returned for the first date before requesting for second date, and properly order them 11 - \nwe can´t use an RXJS operator  to catch only 5 random results of retrieved data, take() operator here doesn't work because values should be emitted by the API one by one, and all events for a date are all emitted together.\n\nAs said, we will use dataToShow property, which is customEvents type, to store filtered data, then pass it to show-days-component's property called arrayOfObjectsWithEvents, and through a viewchild, pass the value to modal child component and be able to show it.\n\nTo handle error, we use a property called modalError with custom type error interface called customError, on that error we set the error response values we are interested in.\n\nAlso use the reject() keyword which, like resolve() is like a return. It is used to handle errors, resolve() is to handle sucessful request 12 -\ngetFiveRandomElementsOfArray() will implement the logic to get 5 random events once all results of the API are requested \n\nOTHER METHODS CALLED: \n\n  -isUsedIndex\n\nPARAMETERS: \n\n  -the data object returned by the api, it contains, among others,\n  an events property which is an array with events\n\nRETURNS a randomEvents custom type13 - \nOVERVIEW EXPLANATION:\n\nOn two given dates, for example, \n\n    2004-04-06 and 2018-05-09\n\nwe will calculate the amount of days between them this way:\n\n    - The days for first and last year with a method called calcFirstAndLastYearDays()\n\n    - The days between 2005 and 2017 will be calculated on calcDaysBetweenYears()\n\n    - The total days will be put together on calculateTotalDaysBetweenDates() 14 - \nto order dates, we must prevent it could happen user sets the second date is older (e.g. first date 2018 and second date 2004).\n\nWe will allow that, we will properly order and calculate them. \nI find it better than forcing user to set dates in a \"correct\" order (e.g \"2nd date must be higher than 1st\" I dont like that)\n\nAs date1 and date2 will be an array of numbers with year, month and day separated, we will store both arrays on orderedDatesArray, and as it is an array of arrays, we declare it as number[][]15 - \n    convertArrayOfNumbersIntoString()\n\nThis method does the reverse operation of splitStringDateIntoArrayOfNumbers.\n\nTo show on modal and properly play with datepipes we need the dates as string, so we reverse the dates as array of numbers we have operated with, and revert back to strings.\n\nI realised perhaps it would have been a better idea to have the string dates we get from the form at home-component, \n  \n    firstYearToCheckDateString\n\nand \n\n    lastYearToCheckDateString\n  \nas properties of this service and not as home-component-properties.\n\nNow perhaps this method would not have been neccessary, and would be a better designed app. But I am here to learn :)\n\nAlso maybe we would save some inherit of properties from parent to child components\n\nPARAMETERS: The array of numbers to convert to String\nRETURNS: the Date as string16 -\n    isLeapYearCheck()\n\nWe need to know if year is Leap or not, to add one more day to the year in that case\n\nPARAMETERS: The year (only the year), to be checked\n\nRETURNS: true if is Leap, otherwise false17 - \n    calcFirstAndLastYearDays()\n\nPARAMETERS will be the full date given as array of numbers with year, month and date\n\nRETURNS: an array of numbers, with two number elements:\n    -days from 01/01 to given value (for example, days between 01/01 from 04/07/2015)\n    -days from given value to 31/12 for example, days from 04/07/2015 to 31/12 same year).\n    -If year is leap, we will add one day to one of the two above results,where february is involved and then must be counted18 - \nFirst, we calculate \n\n    daysPassed from 01-01 until selected Date, that will be daysPassed\n\nThen, to get daysRemaining, we substract daysPassed to 365 or 366, depending if year is leap or not\n\n  365 or 366 - daysPassed = daysRemaining\n\nWe will return an array with both values: daysPassed and daysRemaining19 - \n    calcDaysBetweenYears()\n\ncalculate days between the years of 2 given years (only years), taking into account if it is leap year or not.\n\n    Example: 2006-04-06 and 2018-05-09 \n    \nthis method will calculate the days between 2005 and 2017.\n\n2004 and 2018 days would be calculated by calcFirstAndLastYearDays()  \n\n\nPARAMETERS:\n  the two years (as said, not dates, just the years).\n\nRETURNS localTotalDaysBetweenYears, a number with the total days between the two given years.\n\n20 -\n\n        localTotalDaysBetweenYears variable\n\n    To the name localTotalDaysBetweenYears, I added \"local\" to clarify between that variable and other variables or properties used on this service, for example the totalDaysBetweenDates property, or the daysBetweenYears variable which is used on calculateTotalDaysBetweenDates(),to avoid name confussions because they are similar.\n  \n    localTotalDaysBetweenYears stores only the total days between two given years.\n\n    For example between 2004 and 2018, it will store total days between 2005 and 2017, and its value will be returned to a variable with similar name called daysBetweenYears inside the method calculateTotalDaysBetweenDates()  \n\n    totalDaysBetweenDates is a service property, and stores the TOTAL days between the two given dates, the final result.\n\n    This local variable will only change if PARAMETERS (years) are different\n\n    Also I considered better to use a local variable and not a property\n    which could not exist on another project, this way is more reusable.  21 - \nNow we get the days betweeen minor year +1 and highest given year, that is so because each of the given years` total days will be calculated on calcFirstAndLastYearDays()  \n  \ne.g: between 2004(minorYear) and 2018 (highestYear) on this method we would iterate between 2005 and 2017.\n\n2004 and 2018 days would be calculated by calcFirstAndLastYearDays()22 - \n    calculateTotalDaysBetweenDates()\n\nThis is the method where final result will be produced and stored on the totalDaysBetweenDates property\n\nPARAMETERS the two dates\n\nRETURNS nothing, since the total result will be stored on a service property called totalDaysBetweenDates23 - \nif one year is different from the other, we add the results. \n\nFor example, between 2004-04-06 and 2018-05-09:\n    - Days from 2004-04-06 to 2004-31-12 (daysLeftDate1)\n    - days between 2007 and 2017 (daysBetweenYears) \n    - Days from 2018-01-01 to 2018-05-09 (daysPassedDate2)\n\nObviously we always have checked if years are leap or not\n\nIf the year is the same, for example, 2004-04-06 and 2004-08-09, we will check if that year is leap, and set the amount of total days accordingly to 365 or 366.\n\nThen to obntain the difference (days passed between one date and another) we substract to 365 or 366 the results of days passed from 01-01 until first given date, adding the days remaning until 31-12 from second given date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
